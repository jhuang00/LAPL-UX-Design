# Happiness at Home — Redesigning the Los Angeles Public Library Application

### Introduction

The Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) is a public library system that serves residents in LA, serving the largest population among all publicly funded library systems in the United States of over 18 million residents. Holding more than 6 million volumes, the LAPL system provides books, zines, periodicals, computer access, and audiovisual materials freely to the residents. The Los Angeles Public Library Application has its main feature being the searching and finding for items in the library catalog. Moreover, there should be help documents and guidance. The LAPL APP needs to be accessible and easy to understand for all users, including the users we are focusing on — middle-aged women.


### Design statement 

With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered a period of time when people are facing instability and uncertainty. As Los Angeles continues to be in a state of lockdown, more people are experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and fear. Although middle-aged women are not usually under the spotlight of the social realm of discussion, they are a group that cannot be neglected. Focusing on the happiness of middle-aged women, I hope to, in this project, explore a way of providing an outlet of the real world that is safe and fulfilling. Improving the user experience, my product can make sure these users can find the process of using the product enjoyable and that the overall experience brings happiness.


### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

I conducted heuristic evaluation at the beginning of my competitor analysis of the LAPL website and APP. In the heuristic evaluation, I used Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design for this analysis, providing severity ratings, analyses, and recommendations to each principle. I found that some issues that would need to be addressed are: aesthetic and minimalist design, user control and freedom, and help and documentation.

### Competitor analysis: Usability Testing

Not only did I do the heuristic evaluation, but I also made sure to incoporate the user's perspective to examine the competing product's usability. I used participatory observation and interview as the research methods for the contextual inquiry study. To begin with, I employed the interview method and ask background questions to the participant. I asked about her experience with library-related topics including her previous experience with books, and her impression on libraries. I mainly used the method of observation in the middle of the study when I asked the participant to participate in some user activities on the website and the APP. Her behaviors for the activities were screen-recorded. Finally, the participant were asked some follow-up questions in an interview format. They tend to be more specifically about the activity or the product, such as how the user would rate the product, whether there were difficulties encountered during the activities, and how the user experience was.

See the complete documentation of usability testing [here](https://github.com/jhuang00/DH150-JH/blob/main/Assignment04/README.md).


### UX storytelling

I started doing preparations for my design through UX storytelling, creating personas along with their scenarios and journey maps. UX storytelling allows me to dive deep into the user's stories and scenarios, and see what the roles of the product is. It ensures that my design is user-centered and human-centered. I used 2 personas and looked at how the LAPL application can fit into their stories.

Based on the persona and storytelling, I found out the users' common main task is to search for and borrow items from the library catalog. Therefore, features that the design would focus on are: item search, results recommendation, item request, and help documentation.


### Low-fidelity prototype

The low-fidelity prototyping allows me to put the concepts and the results from the user research into realistic frames. The low-fidelity prototypes shows wireframes along with interaction flows, outlining the features and interactions the project can provide. I tested the prototype with a tester, going through all the designed tasks, which ensures the design and the flow is good from a user’s perspective. This served for great planning and building the skeletons of the high-fidelity prototypes and the final project.

These tasks, or features are realized in the low-fidelity prototype:
* Searching for an item
  * Search in the library catalog, using the Quick Search method
  * Search in the library catalog, using the Advanced Search method
  * Search in the library catalog, using the Featured Search method
* Requesting for an item
  * after doing a search (of any kind of search you wish), request for borrowing a book, using the traditional method
  * Request for borrowing a book, by exploring the "Smart Recommendation” feature
* Getting help
  * In the middle of searching in the library catalog, go to see “Help” documentation for guidance, find the instruction for how to do Advanced Search, then go back and do Advanced Search

### Evaluation and revision history

I went through accessibility check to check that the color constrast satisfies the accessibility WCAG2.0 AA level. Also, I did impression tests and cognitive walkthroughs with testers to make sure the task flow is nice and user experience is good.

There were some iterations in the prototype design process. For example, going through interactive details, I realized I could make my design better or correct my design by making components more visible, or by making sure the interactive flow is always smooth.

### Final Remarks

Going through each step in the project and realizing the product was a rewarding experience. I have learned that all the work done before creating the high-fidelity prototype build great and crucial foundation. While I was working on the hi-fi prototypes, the prototypes went out naturally because there were enough planning and research done before the process. Even though I was constantly adjusting the design, it was more about the details and the aesthetics, and less about the big structure since it was laid out with the wireframes. 

Moreover, I found that I was able to achieve most things I wished to achieve in the end. When creating the hi-fi prototypes, it was interesting for me to explore and make some screens scrollable while keeping some components fixed on the screen. However, there are also some ideas that I could not fully build into my prototype, perhaps due to the prototyping tool and my familiarity with it. For example, a feature which I hoped to but was unable to do is letting a message show only once for the user, after which they could specify whether they wish to see the message or not (by checking or unchecking a checkbox). These features would make the prototype even more realistic; however, the main goal of the project is achieved, and my design focused on usability and accessibility, making the process of using APP as smooth as possible.

Overall, this LAPL APP design successfully achieved the design features and tasks, such that it can provide good user experience for users who need to explore the library catalog and borrow items from it. This design of the LAPL APP enhance some usability issues; however, it can still be potentially improved. It would be better if more usability testing were done. Also, it showcases the most essential feature of the LAPL APP only; therefore, further design can improve on designing a more complete version of the product.
